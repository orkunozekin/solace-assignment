# TODO: Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would focus on these enhancements:

## Testing Infrastructure

- **Unit testing for API endpoints** - Add comprehensive test coverage for all REST endpoints
- **Unit testing for UI components** - Implement component tests using Jest/React Testing Library
- **End-to-end test suite** - Create automated E2E tests with Cypress or Playwright

## User Experience Enhancements

- **Enhanced table loading states** - There's a brief no-data state when the table initially loads, so I would improve this
- **Improved empty state handling** - Design more informative and actionable "no data" states with helpful messaging (depending on whether a search input was made)
